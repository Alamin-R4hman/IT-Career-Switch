  <!--Let’s break down the display properties:

  display: block;:

The element takes up the full width available.
Starts on a new line.
Examples: <div>, <h1>, <p>.

  display: inline;:

The element takes up only as much width as necessary.
Does not start on a new line; it sits inline with other elements.
Cannot have width and height set.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <em>.

  display: inline-block;:

The element takes up only as much width as necessary.
Does not start on a new line; it sits inline with other elements.
Can have width and height set.
Examples: <img>, <button>.

A simple way to think about it is like this.
Let’s think of it like a row of toy shelves:

Block: Imagine a big toy box that takes up the whole shelf. Nothing else can fit next to it.

Inline: Think of small toy cars that can line up side by side on the same shelf.

Inline-block: Like a medium-sized toy box that can sit next to other boxes or cars on the shelf.

These help decide how things line up on a webpage.

<h2>Block:</h2>

<div style="display: block; background: lightblue;">Block Element</div>
<div style="display: block; background: lightgreen;">Another Block Element</div>

<p>code: <br>

Each div starts on a new line and takes up the full width.</p>

<h2>Inline:</h2>

<span style="display: inline; background: lightblue;">Inline Element</span>
<span style="display: inline; background: lightgreen;">Another Inline Element</span>

<p>code:<br>

Both span elements sit on the same line, taking up only as much width as needed.</p>

<h2>Inline-Block:</h2>

<div style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; background: lightblue;">Inline-Block Element</div>
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; background: lightgreen;">Another Inline-Block Element</div>

<p>code:<br>

Both div elements sit on the same line, but you can set their width and height.
Understanding these properties helps you control how elements are laid out on the page.</p>


<h3>
You:
so what if an elemnt is a block elemnt and i set it as display inline</h3>

<p>If you set a block element to display: inline;, it will behave like an inline element. This means: </p>

<p>Width and Height: The element will only take up as much width as its content requires. You cannot set its width and height.
Line Behavior: The element will sit inline with other elements, not starting on a new line.
Box Model: Margins and padding will still apply, but the element will not break to a new line.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div style="display: inline; background: lightblue;">Inline Div</div>
<span style="background: lightgreen;">Inline Span</span>

<p>code:<br>

In this example:</p>

<p>The div with display: inline; will sit on the same line as the span.
The div will only be as wide as its content, similar to the span.
This can be useful for making block elements behave</p>

Understanding display properties in CSS is crucial for controlling the layout of elements on a webpage. Here’s a brief overview of the key display properties:

display: block;
Behavior: Takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
Examples: <div>, <h1>, <p>.
Use Case: When you want an element to occupy its own line and take up the full width of its container.

display: inline;
Behavior: Takes up only as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <em>.
Use Case: When you want elements to sit next to each other on the same line.

display: inline-block;
Behavior: Takes up only as much width as necessary, does not start on a new line, but can have width and height set.
Examples: <img>, <button>.
Use Case: When you want elements to sit next to each other but still be able to set their width and height.

<!--
Block Element: Takes up the full width and starts on a new line.
Inline Element: Sits on the same line as other inline elements.
Inline-Block Element: Sits on the same line but can have a set width and height.

Practical Use:
Block: Use for sections, articles, divs that need to take up full width.
Inline: Use for text elements that need to flow within a paragraph.
Inline-Block: Use for buttons, images, or other elements that need to sit inline but have specific dimensions.

what is the default value of an image?

The default display value of an image (<img> element) is inline. This means images line up next to other inline elements, like text, without starting on a new line. However, they can have dimensions set, unlike regular inline elements.

You
so if i set the image to have a value of block it would take a new line and take the entire width so other elements cant be next to it?

Yes, exactly! Setting an image’s display value to block makes it start on a new line and take up the full width of its container. This means no other elements can sit next to it on the same line.

You
so inline-block does what? i feel like inline is the same as it

inline-block is a mix of both inline and block:

Like inline, it allows elements to sit next to each other on the same line.
Like block, it lets you set width and height.
So, inline-block elements can be sized like blocks but still line up like inline elements. This is useful for arranging items side by side while controlling their size.

You
so normal inline elements can't have their width or height set?

Correct! Normal inline elements cannot have their width or height set. They only take up as much space as their content needs. This is why inline-block is useful, as it allows setting width and height while still letting elements sit side by side.
