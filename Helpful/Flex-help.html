<!-- 
inline-flex and flex serve different purposes, and the choice depends on the layout needs:

Use display: flex; when:

You want the container to behave like a block element.
The container should take up the full width of its parent.
You need the container to start on a new line.
Use display: inline-flex; when:

You want the container to behave like an inline element.
The container should sit inline with other elements on the same line.
You need to align the container with text or other inline elements.
Example scenarios:

flex: Creating a full-width navigation bar.
inline-flex: Aligning a group of buttons with text in a paragraph.
Each has its use case, and choosing the right one depends on the specific layout requirements.

.cards {
  background-color: #ffc200;
  display:flex;
  flex-wrap:wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.col {
display: inline-flex;
}

The selected code defines styles for the cards and col classes. The .cards class sets a yellow background, uses flexbox for layout, allows items to wrap, and spaces them evenly

The CSS properties in the .cards class are meant to style the container that holds the columns, while the .col class styles the individual columns. Here’s why they are separated:

Container vs. Items:

.cards is the flex container that controls the layout of its child elements (the columns).
.col is for the individual columns inside the flex container.
Flexbox Layout:

display: flex; on .cards makes it a flex container, allowing it to control the layout of its children.
flex-wrap: wrap; on .cards allows the columns to wrap to the next line if they don’t fit in one row.
justify-content: space-around; on .cards spaces the columns evenly.
Background Color:

background-color: #ffc200; on .cards sets the background color for the entire container, not just individual columns.
If you put all the CSS in the .col class, each column would become a flex container, which is not the intended layout. The goal is to have .cards as the flex container and .col as the flex items.

Example:

.cards {
  background-color: #ffc200;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.col {
  display: inline-flex;
}

code

.cards controls the overall layout and appearance of the container.
.col controls the layout and appearance of the individual
