The return statement is used in a function to:

Output a Value: It specifies the value that the function will output when called. This value can be used elsewhere in the code.

End Function Execution: It immediately stops the execution of the function. Any code after return within the function will not run.

Provide Results: When a function performs calculations or processes data, return is used to provide the result back to the caller.

For example:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b
}

let sum = add(3, 4); // sum will be 7

code

In this example, return is used to output the sum of a and b, allowing the result to be stored in the variable sum.
